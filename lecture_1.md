<h2>Topic-1 : Programming Language</h2><br>Date - 23/08/2024<br>
Imagine talking to a computer is like speaking a special language that only it understands. Computers don't know English or Spanish; they use something called "machine language," which is just a bunch of numbers like 1s and 0s. But writing in machine language is super tricky and time-consuming. That's where programming languages come in—they’re like different ways to talk to the computer in a more human-friendly way. For example, instead of writing tons of 1s and 0s, you can use words and symbols that are easier to understand. When you write a program, you're giving the computer a set of instructions on what to do, like how to play a game or solve a puzzle. So, programming languages help us give the computer clear and simple commands to make it do what we want.<br><br>
<b>Programming Language - </b> A programming language is a set of rules and symbols that people use to write instructions for computers. It’s a way to communicate with computers and tell them what tasks to perform. Think of it like a special language with its own grammar and vocabulary designed to give the computer clear directions. Just as we use languages like English or Spanish to talk to each other, we use programming languages to talk to computers and make them do things like solve math problems, run games, or show us websites. Examples of programming languages include Python, JavaScript, and Java.<br><br>
<b>Computer Program - </b> A computer program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a specific task or solve a problem. It’s like a recipe that tells the computer step-by-step how to do something, whether it’s playing a video, sorting numbers, or running a game.<br><br>
The difference between a computer program and code is that a program is the complete set of instructions that performs a specific task, while code refers to the individual lines of instructions written in a programming language that make up the program. So, code is the building material, and the program is the finished product that runs on the computer.<br><br>
