<h2>Types of Computer Programs</h2>
<h3>1. System Software</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Operating Systems</strong>: Software that manages hardware and software resources (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS).</li>
  <li><strong>Device Drivers</strong>: Programs that allow the operating system to communicate with hardware components (e.g., printer drivers).</li>
  <li><strong>Utilities</strong>: Programs that perform maintenance tasks (e.g., antivirus software, disk cleanup tools).</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Application Software</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Productivity Software</strong>: Tools for tasks like word processing and spreadsheets (e.g., Microsoft Office, Google Docs).</li>
  <li><strong>Media Players</strong>: Software for playing multimedia files (e.g., VLC Media Player).</li>
  <li><strong>Web Browsers</strong>: Programs for accessing and navigating the web (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Development Software</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</strong>: Tools for coding, debugging, and compiling (e.g., Visual Studio, PyCharm).</li>
  <li><strong>Compilers and Interpreters</strong>: Tools that translate code into machine language (e.g., GCC for C/C++, Python interpreter).</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Games</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Video Games</strong>: Interactive software for entertainment (e.g., Fortnite, Minecraft).</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Embedded Systems</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Firmware</strong>: Software programmed into hardware devices (e.g., software in a router, smart appliance).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Differences Between Computer Program, Code, and Script</h2>
<h3>1. Computer Program</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Definition</strong>: A computer program is a set of instructions that a computer executes to perform specific tasks. It is a complete, executable file or collection of files that performs a particular function.</li>
  <li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Programs can be large and complex, often built using various code modules and libraries. They are usually compiled or interpreted into machine language that the computer can run.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Code</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Code refers to the written instructions in a programming language that make up a program or a part of a program. It is the raw text written by developers using a programming language.</li>
  <li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Code is often written in a high-level programming language like Python, Java, or C++. Code must be compiled or interpreted to become a working program.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Script</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Definition</strong>: A script is a type of program that is typically shorter and used for automating tasks. Scripts are usually interpreted rather than compiled and often written in scripting languages like Python, JavaScript, or Bash.</li>
  <li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Scripts are generally used to automate repetitive tasks, manipulate data, or run commands in a sequence. They are often used in system administration, web development, or for short-term tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Computer Program</strong>: A complete set of instructions that can be executed to perform specific tasks. It includes both the code and the compiled or interpreted form that runs on a computer.</li>
  <li><strong>Code</strong>: The raw text written in a programming language that makes up part or all of a program.</li>
  <li><strong>Script</strong>: A type of program that is usually interpreted, shorter in length, and used for automation and task execution.</li>
</ul>
